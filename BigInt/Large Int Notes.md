I remember Akshay talking about his russian peasant algorithm with me for a brief minute and how it kinda worked by spliting the big number into halves and storing them somewhere. 

Hearing people talk about Lists, Arrays, and Strings (plural) I get the impression that we're gonna be somehow separating Large numbers into smaller numbers saved in memory to operate on a smaller scale. 

Kinda like building a pyramid brick by brick vs an alien droping the thing on some poor hapless pharaoh underneath.
